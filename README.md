## Approach & Experience

After analyzing the requirements provided, I decided on the technologies and tools, then started the design of the database and the Back-end so that it accommodates to the access and permissions to the different roles.
The different endpoints were designed according to the needs of the Front-end.

## What I liked:

I really liked working on a project that allowed me to handle various roles with different permissions and options, and further learn new functionalities such as CAPTCHAÂ implementation.

## What I didn't like

Concerning what I disliked, I didn't have anything that I disliked as I saw the difficulties as opportunities to learn.

## where I faced challenges

The issue that I saw as a challenge the most is the appointment functionality, since I had to handle the appointments addition and details based on each role differently, especiallyÂ theÂ GuestÂ role.

## What's pending

I focused on completing the whole project with all its functionalities, which took me around 4 days, so I made sure to have nothing pendingÂ fromÂ myÂ side.
